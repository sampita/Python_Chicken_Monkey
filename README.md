# Python_Chicken_Monkey

## Practice: ChickenMonkey
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. You can use Python's `range()` to quickly make a list of numbers.

    - For multiples of five (5, 10, 15, etc.) print "Chicken" instead of the number
    - For the multiples of seven (7, 14, 21, etc.) print "Monkey".
    - For numbers which are multiples of both five and seven print "ChickenMonkey".
To determine if a number can be evenly divided by 5 or 7, use the Python `modulo` operator.
